Hi, I’m Abram — a tech enthusiast with a strong focus on network defense, threat detection, and system hardening. I work as a Cybersecurity Operations Specialist, securing both Windows and Linux environments through hands-on incident response and proactive threat hunting. In my spare time, I enjoy diving into offensive security labs and red team simulations to sharpen my skills and better understand the adversary mindset.
Always learning, always evolving.
